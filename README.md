# 🌬️ Wind Turbine Energy Project

### 📅 Physics Project - June 2024

Welcome to our physics project on the use of wind turbines as a source of energy.

### 📄 Instructions

Detailed instructions for running the programs and understanding the analyses are provided in the PDF file named `coding_project_guidelines.pdf`. This document includes the steps to follow for the project. Please refer to this document for comprehensive guidelines.

### 🎯 Objective of the Programs

The objective of this project is to analyze wind data from various locations to determine the optimal site for installing a wind-energy farm. Our Python program processes real-life wind datasets to:

- Extract and visualize relevant wind-related features
- Calculate key metrics such as wind speed distributions and capacity factors
- Compare the performance of different wind turbine models
- Provide informed recommendations for the most efficient wind turbine installation

### 📁 Directory Organization

The project directory contains three folders, each corresponding to a different city, named after the coder responsible:

- **William_PELTIER**
  - Contains the notebook `Nimes.ipynb` and the associated `Nimes.csv` file
- **Octave_HORLIN**
  - Contains the notebook `Paris.ipynb` and the associated `Paris.csv` file
- **Ghali_BENNIS**
  - Contains the notebook `Lyon.ipynb` and the associated `Lyon.csv` file

### 🛠️ How to Run the Code

Running our code is straightforward:

1. Open the desired Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` file) in a Python environment.
2. Execute the cells to process and visualize the wind data.
3. To change the year for any specific analysis, modify the `year` variable in the last line of the relevant code cell.

### 💡 Responses to Open Questions

Answers to the open questions are provided in Markdown format directly within each notebook. These responses include detailed analysis and insights derived from the wind data.

### 📊 Visualization and Analysis

Each notebook contains visualizations such as:

- Wind speed distributions
- Capacity factor calculations
- Performance comparisons of different wind turbine models

These visualizations aid in making data-driven decisions for the optimal installation of wind turbines.

### 🎉 Enjoy!

Feel free to explore and enjoy the project. If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,

William PELTIER, Octave HORLIN & Ghali BENNIS
